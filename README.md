During the development, I utilized tools familiar to me, such as MySQL for database management, Eclipse as my development environment, and Git for version control, while also integrating new tools such as WindowBuilder. Drawing from my experience working in the service industry, I developed a finance tracker application designed to monitor earnings, provide predictions, and deliver visual/analytical metrics for income. This project further developed my skills in testing and debugging to ensure a seamless user experience, resulting in a scalable desktop application.
